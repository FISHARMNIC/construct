Use template functions to allow floats and it sums etc
Cpp has native lamdba support too
Basic data types arent classes until they need to be
    -> for example numbers can just be base numbers until a method is called
    -> js     : let bob = 10; bob.valueOf()
    -> becomes: int bob = 10; Number.valueOf(&bob);
